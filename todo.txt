[x] RGB numbers right align
[x] floating point available in CHDK 1.6 imath -> fmath
[ ] choose inverse gamma coefficients sRGB, Rec.709 etc
[ ] input value table choice more chars than 6
[ ] @param @default
[ ] raw sensor probably have some gamma need experimental
    measurements
[ ] check light intensity to sensor reading relation
    (lamp away sqrt(2)x = 1.41x should make brigtness 1/2x)
    (2 lamps and 1 lamp, brightness 1/2x)
[ ] simple bracketing example
[ ] 48->96 to reduce brightness by 2
[ ] calib point 1-3, set camera to M-manual
    each point replaces one row in calib matrix
[ ] test are both green in rgbg develop to same green color
[x] dot product matrix . matrix
[x] cal file should now be (int1E6, unfolded array)
    R1 G1 B1 x1 y1 Y1
    R2 G2 B2 x2 y2 Y2
    R3 G3 B3 x3 y3 Y3
[ ] exposure calibration?
[x] RGB->xyY direct option
[x] calibration: notify on-screen input RGB and target xyY
[x] rename draw->stamp
[ ] calib to XYZ
[x] output and stamp XYZ
[x] LAB values, calibration and output, formula is at
    http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_XYZ_to_Lab.html
[x] stamp Lab at calib screen
[ ] print XYZ and Lab
[ ] cleanup multiple code and join common parts
    shoot_measure_stamp, calibrate, colorimetry
