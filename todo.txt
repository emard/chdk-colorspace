[x] RGB numbers right align
[x] floating point available in CHDK 1.6 imath -> fmath
[ ] choose inverse gamma coefficients sRGB, Rec.709 etc
[ ] input value table choice more chars than 6
[ ] camera raw sensor readings ignore camera manual
    white balance. Make internal white balance
[ ] raw sensor probably have some gamma, experimental
    exposure: 1/x   1/2x  1/4x
    readings: 0.150 0.110 0.077
[ ] check light intensity to sensor reading relation
    (lamp away sqrt(2)x = 1.41x should make brigtness 1/2x)
    (2 lamps and 1 lamp, brightness 1/2x)
