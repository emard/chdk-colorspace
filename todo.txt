[x] RGB numbers right align
[x] floating point available in CHDK 1.6 imath -> fmath
[ ] choose inverse gamma coefficients sRGB, Rec.709 etc
[ ] input value table choice more chars than 6
[ ] camera raw sensor readings ignore camera manual
    white balance. Make internal white balance
[ ] raw sensor probably have some gamma, experimental
    exposure: 1/x   1/2x  1/4x
    readings: 0.150 0.110 0.077
[ ] check light intensity to sensor reading relation
    (lamp away sqrt(2)x = 1.41x should make brigtness 1/2x)
    (2 lamps and 1 lamp, brightness 1/2x)
[ ] simple bracketing example
[ ] 48->96 to reduce brightness by 2
[ ] calib point 1-3, set camera to M-manual
    each point replaces one row in calib matrix
[ ] test are both green in rgbg develop to same green color
[x] dot product matrix . matrix
[ ] cal file should now be (int1E6, unfolded array)
    R1 G1 B1 x1 y1 Y1
    R2 G2 B2 x2 y2 Y2
    R3 G3 B3 x3 y3 Y3
[ ] exposure calibration?
[ ] RGB->xyY direct?
